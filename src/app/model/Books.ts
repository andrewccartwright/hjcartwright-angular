  Have you ever found yourself in a situation that just seems to get messier by the second? 
  Well, I have. Quite a few times. But researching the Cult of Creatio was slowly becoming 
  the messiest situation yet.
  <br><br>
  To make matters worse, I was slowly falling for the one man I shouldn't. 
  The man my mentor had sworn me off. The man who was slowly invading my every thought. 
  The man who decided to help me research the cult and I was now spending almost every day with. 
  That man was William Bly.

  Love wasn't something I did. It was something I avoided. I had spent a lifetime keeping 
  the darkness within myself hidden. Love could expose it. I avoided it like the plague.
  <br><br>
  Yet, every time I looked at Jackie James, the darkness disappeared bit by bit. 
  She was slowly becoming my world. But, I couldn't have her. Couldn't love her.
  <br><br>
  Right?`

  I would do anything for my daughter. 
  Including marrying my sister's best friend. A man that drove me crazy because he was inexplicably calm. 
  A man that made me feel cared for in ways I didn't know possible.
  A man that would help me keep custody of my daughter.
  <br><br>
  And just when I thought everything was going right in my life, the Cult of Creatio reared its head and 
  threatened the most important person to me.
  <br><br>
  <em>My daughter.</em>

  I didn't make rash decisions. I was smart and methodical with my decisions. 
  But when it came to Theodora James, my best friend's sister, all rational thinking went out the window.
  <br><br>
  That's why I proposed on a whim in a coffee shop.
  <br><br>
  That's why I married her only a week later.
  <br><br>
  But how would I keep her safe when the cult that threatened our family was hidden in 
  the shadows we were only now bringing to light?

  Surviving as a captive for nearly eight years was hard. 
  Recovering from those years was harder. I couldn't trust my thoughts, 
  my memories, or my dreams. Detective Scarlett Guerrero, the only assigned 
  security detail I hadn't tried to escape from, had become my only reprieve 
  from my mind. She offered safety, warmth, and light in my dimly lit reality.
  Scarlett was all I wanted.
  <br><br>
  Getting involved with me put her at risk. The people who had taken me were still out there. 
  The people who had harassed and attacked my family for years had never been captured.
  <br><br>
  Would I have to choose between keeping her safe and keeping her?

  <br><br>
  <strong class='names'><i>Scarlett</i></strong>
  <br>
  Being assigned as Nate James' security detail was the start of a slippery slope. 
  I was supposed to keep him safe from the people who held him captive for nearly eight years. 
  I needed to find the people responsible for hurting him and his family. 
  I wasn't supposed to get lost in his icy blue eyes, 
  I wasn't supposed to spend every night with him as he battled his nightmares, 
  I wasn't supposed to fall head over heels for him. If my captain were to find out about our relationship, my career would be over.

  <br><br>
  Being with Nate James risked everything I had worked for.
  <br><br>
  Was he worth the risk?
